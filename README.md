Python 3 Async shell Accelerated.
The aim of this repository is to share python3 scripts to increase your shell productivity.
Currently only one script is available but I have some other scripts ideas ;)

## async_bash.py
This script allow to write a shell command line integrating one to many iterators.
The script will evaluates these iterators, collect all the commands, run them asynchronously and show the result using a json format.
